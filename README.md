I was a participating speaking panelist for the Cisco Insider Series for Networking. Where I spoke about the results from the validation testing on the Cisco DIRL feature and the effects on SAN congestion.

As businesses rely more on their data, increased pressure is placed on storage area networks (SANs) to accelerate the organizationsâ€™ access to data. This increased pressure makes eliminating SAN congestion a key priority for many IT organizations. No need to worry; Cisco can help. In this webinar, alongside Miercom subject matter experts, we will discuss SAN congestion, Miercom's validation report for Cisco MDS, and how Cisco MDS prevents SAN congestion. A live demo is also included. Join us to learn how to prevent congestion from infecting your storage network.

The roundtable agenda includes:

What causes SAN congestion
How to identify and resolve SAN congestion before it impacts the business
Results from the Miercom performance validation report for Cisco MDS
Cisco Dynamic Ingress Rate Limiting (DIRL) live demo
